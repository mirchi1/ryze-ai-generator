i, I'm Vachana. For my project, I built a deterministic UI generator. I used a React component library so the AI stays within design bounds. As you can see, when I ask for a 'red dashboard' in the chat, the agent updates the code props, changes the live preview instantly, and explains its decision in the sidebar.This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`]
