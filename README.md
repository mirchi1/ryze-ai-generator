Hi, I'm Vachana. For my project, I built a deterministic UI generator built with Next.js and React-Live. It uses a structured component registry to translate natural language prompts into consistent, production-ready UI components

Real-time Code Execution: Uses react-live to instantly compile and render the AI's generated code string into a visual preview.

Agent Transparency: Includes an "Agent Explanation" module that clarifies the reasoning behind the specific layout choices (e.g., grouping search elements in a card).

State Management: Features a Rollback mechanism to manage UI versions, allowing users to revert to previous successful generations.
